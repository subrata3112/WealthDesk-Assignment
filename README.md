Known Bugs/Missings:-

- There is no class for Parking Slots. So app doesn't realises whether it freed a bike space or car space.
- No setters/getters used.
- For sake of simplicity, only hourly basis of rates are described in rateChart.
- Admins can only access one parking lot at a time.
- No errors/exception handling methods applied.
- No authentication added. User class is not getting completely used.
- User Info not getting saved.
- Had to merge guard and admin users to avoid complications in some methods.
- getHistory not working.
- time objects are not handled properly. Thus TotalAmount is storing garbage value.
- Using Constructors was giving error while defining an empty object and also in passing an object in a method. Therefore removed.
